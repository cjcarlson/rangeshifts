Title: Range Shift Estimates from Historical Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Colin J. Carlson
Maintainer: Colin J. Carlson <cjc322@georgetown.edu>
Description: This package streamlines the process of tracking range shifts based on historical range data, using a combination of interval comparison methods and regressions. As more methods are developed I hope this will become crowdsourced and more robust, but right now the goal is to mostly cover methods used by studies covered in Chen et al. (2011)
