#' @title Range Shifs from Historical Data
#'
#' @description This package streamlines the process of tracking range shifts based on historical range data, using a combination of interval comparison methods and regressions. As more methods are developed I hope this will become crowdsourced and more robust, but right now the goal is to mostly cover methods used by studies covered in Chen et al. (2011)
